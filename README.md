## Planned features

### Player Deck

Ditch the playing cards, play on your phone! <br/>
Add the playing cards to your app and create your deck from them. We don't have all characters unlocked to provide all the cards, but maybe some day we will!

### Attack Modifier

It only makes sense! Once you have your action cards, why shouldn't you use the attack modifier deck?
